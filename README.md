## Basics & features
baseline: initial objective assessment (>= 1/3 NO -> failed, OR x%)
each session: cold probe OR %age on at least ~10 tries, comments/observations
acquired when...: e.g. YES 3 consecutive sessions, ~90% for ~3 consec. sessions
when acquired, ~1 week break, then retention probe (reminder?)
retention probe failed -> suggest higher criterium?

weekly cumulative graph for retention (add week's total and add new point), w/ condition change lines??
